# CO2 Emission Prediction - Spain 🌍💨

**Project Title:** Predictive Analysis of CO2 Emission Contributors Based on Industry and Economy Using Random Forest Regression  
**Case Study:** Spain from 2010 to 2022  
**Theme:** Green Economy 🌱

This project aims to predict CO2 emissions based on industrial and economic indicators in Spain, focusing on the principles of a **Green Economy**. By leveraging **Random Forest Regression**, we aim to identify key drivers of CO2 emissions and promote data-driven strategies to minimize emissions and foster sustainable development.
